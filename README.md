Start by loading the QCtech360 Model example .zip file, extract the content and save the folder called “cacao” and “QCtech360 - model runner” to your disk (C:). 
Open the “QCtech360.exe” stored in the folder “QCtech360 - model runner”
This opens the QCtech360 UI on your desk-top (it can take a minute):
 
Now you need to disable the demo mode in the “Option” field
Then you click “Run Prediction Model” (this can take a minute)
When the results are ready, the application will notify you and the results are automatically visualized on a pie chart while the details of the prediction are available as a .csv file in the folder “cacao” you originally stored at your C:\ drive.
! note: at the moment, the application runs only the “cut test” prediction regardless of the model  you would choose.
